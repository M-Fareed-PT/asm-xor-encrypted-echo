# 🔐 x86 Assembly XOR Encrypted Echo  
A 16-bit real-mode x86 Assembly program that reads keyboard input, encrypts it using XOR, and prints the encrypted output to screen.

This project demonstrates low-level I/O, simple cryptography, BIOS interrupts, and buffer handling.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Reads keystrokes from keyboard  
✔ Applies XOR encryption (custom key)  
✔ Prints the encrypted characters  
✔ Uses BIOS interrupts (INT 16h & INT 10h)  
✔ Runs in QEMU / BOCHS / VirtualBox  
✔ Fully standalone binary
